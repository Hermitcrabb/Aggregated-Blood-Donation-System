# Web Frontend (Next.js)

This is the modular **React (Next.js 14)** frontend for the Aggregated Blood Donation System.  


## Dev
- Start backend gateway at **http://localhost:8080**
- In another terminal:
  ```bash
  cd apps/web
  npm i
  npm run dev
  # open http://localhost:3000
  ```

## Notes
- Home shows the circular **Login**/**Register** CTAs with icons.
- "Live Requests Near You" fetches from `/api/requests` (gateway rewrite).
- Add your auth later; for now, itâ€™s public read.
- do get node_modules it is not added
